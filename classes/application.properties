# In production mode we deactivate all logging below WARN-Level
# because SchemaSpy is a command line application.
# We do not want to bother the user with verbose output like initializing the Spring context.
# However this logging level can be customized via command line arguments, properties etc.

# See Spring Boot documentation for details
